# Project Title
Currency Exchange Website Tools & Widgets

## Description
This repository includes tools and widgets useful for a currency exchange website or something similar. 
The files mainly use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as well as the integration of the ThreeJS library and the OpenExchangeRates API.
